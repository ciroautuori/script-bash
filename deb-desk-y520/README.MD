## Usage

1. **Prepare Debian 12 (Minimal) Installation:** Start with a minimal installation of Debian 12. Ensure you have network connectivity.
2. **Download Script:** Copy the `setup.sh` script to the Debian machine.
3. **Make Script Executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```

4. **Run the Script:**

    ```bash
    sudo ./setup.sh
    ```

5. **Reboot:** After the script completes, the system will reboot automatically.
6. **Post-Reboot:** Log in with the user `ciroautuori`. You might need to log out and back in for the docker group changes to take effect.

## Important Notes

- The script assumes the user is named `ciroautuori`. If your user has a different name, you'll need to modify the script accordingly.
- The script installs `nvidia-driver`, `nvidia-kernel-dkms`, and `nvidia-kernel-source`. Be sure to check your system's NVIDIA card for compatibility.
- This script was designed for a specific hardware configuration but can be adapted for other systems.
